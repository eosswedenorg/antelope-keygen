# @PROJECT_NAME@ (cli)

Generate public and private keypair for [Antelope IO](https://antelope.io)

Source code is available at [github.com](https://github.com/eosswedenorg/antelope-keygen)

## Synopsis

```shell
@PROJECT_NAME@ [-h|--help]

@PROJECT_NAME@ [-v]

@PROJECT_NAME@ search [-m] [--l33t] [--threads <num>] [--dict <file1> ...]  [--lang <value> ...]  word_list [count]

@PROJECT_NAME@ benchmark [num_keys]
```

## Description

Output one Antelope key pair if no arguments are given.
Options and subcommands are as follows:

### General flags

| syntax          | Description      |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| -h, --help      | Shows help text. |
| -v              | Shows version    |


### search command

`@PROJECT_NAME@ search [-m] [--l33t] [--threads <num>] [--dict <file1> ...]  [--lang <value> ...]  word_list [count]`

performs a search, finding `count` public keys containing one or more words from `word_list` (separated with ',').

Instead of a list it is possible to specify a file with words (separated with newline '\n') using `file:/path/to/file`

#### Search specific options

#### -m

Monochrome, disables all color output.

#### --leet

Takes each word in `word_list` and find all l33tspeak combinations of that word and uses the new list for the search.

#### --threads num

Use `num` of parallel threads for searching. Default is what the operating system recommends.

#### --dict file
Use words found in `file` (separated by newline) to highlight words in the keys
found (note that the words in this file are not used for search. only for highlight output).

There can be more then one `--dict` flag. In that case contents of all files are merged into one dictionary.

#### --lang value

Same as `--dict` but will use `value` to find a file in `@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_DATADIR@/@CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@/dict`.
There can be more then one `--lang` flag. In that case contents of all files are merged into one dictionary.

#### count

Number of keys to search for (default is 10)


### benchmark command

`@PROJECT_NAME@ benchmark [num_keys]`

performs a benchmark test, generating `num_keys` keys and measuring the time.

#### Benchmark specific options:

#### num_keys

Number of keys to search for (default is 10)
