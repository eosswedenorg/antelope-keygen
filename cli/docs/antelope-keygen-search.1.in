.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
performs a search, finding \fIcount\fR public keys containing one or more words from
\fIword_list\fR (separated with ',').
.PP
Instead of a list it is possible to specify a file with words (separated with newline \fB'\\n'\fR) using
\fIfile:<filename\fR

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show help text.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR
Monochrome, disables all color output.
.TP
.B --l33t
Takes each word in <\fIword_list\fR> and find all l33tspeak combinations of that word and uses the new list for the search.
.TP
\fB\-\-threads\fR \fInum\fR
Use <\fInum\fR> of parallel threads for searching. Default is what the operating system recommends.
.TP
\fB\-\-dict\fR \fIfile\fR
Use words found in \fIfile\fR (separated by newline) to highlight words in the keys found.
.br
There can be more then one \fB\-\-dict\fR flag.
In that case contents of all files are merged into one dictionary.
.br
\fBnote:\fR the words in this file are not used for search. only for highlight output.
.TP
\fB\-\-lang\fR \fIvalue\fR
Same as \fB\-\-dict\fR but will use \fIvalue\fR to find a file in
\fB@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_DATADIR@/@CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@/dict\fR.
.br
There can be more then one \fB\-\-lang\fR flag. In that case contents of all files are merged into one dictionary.
.TP
\fBcount\fR
Number of keys to search for (default is 10)
