.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Output one EOSIO key pair if no arguments are given
.P
Options and subcommands are as follows:

.TP 15
.B -h, --help
Shows this help text.
.TP 15
.B -v
Shows version.
.TP 15
.B search
performs a search, finding
.I <count>
public keys containing one or more words from
.I <word_list>
(separated with ',').
Instead of a list it is possible to specify a file with words (separated with newline '\\n') using
.I file:<filename>
.RS 16
Search specific options:
.RS 2
.TP 20
.B -m
Monochrome, disables all color output.
.TP 20
.B --l33t
Takes each word in
.I <word_list>
and find all l33tspeak combinations of that word and uses the new list for the search.
.TP 20
.B --threads=<num>
Use
.I <num>
of parallel threads for searching. Default is what the operating system recommends.
.TP 20
.B --dict=<file>
Use words found in
.I <file>
(separated by newline) to highlight words in the keys found (note that the words in this
 file are not used for search. only for highlight output). There can be more then one
.B --dict
flag. In that case contents of all files are merged into one dictionary.
.TP 20
.B --lang=<value>
Same as
.B --dict
but will use
.I <value>
to find a file in
.B @CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_DATADIR@/@CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@/dict.
There can be more then one
.B --lang
flag. In that case contents of all files are merged into one dictionary.
.TP 20
.B count
Number of keys to search for (default is 10)
.RE 1
.TP 15
.B benchmark
performs a benchmark test, generating
.I <num_keys>
keys and measuring the time.
.PP
.RS 16
Benchmark specific options:
.RS 2
.TP 15
.B num_keys
Number of keys to search for (default is 10)
.RE 1


.SH SECURITY NOTICE

Keys are generated by OpenSSL\'s
.B EC_KEY_generate_key
function. The program will
never expose your keys to anything but the computers memory and output of the\
program. You are free to inspect the source code and compile yourself to verify.
.P
However, use this at your own risk. we cannot guarantee that the keys are\
cryptographically secure as this depends on OpenSSL's implementation (alto it is\
widely used and should be safe)
