This is the graphical version of [eosio-keygen](https://github.com/eosswedenorg/eosio-keygen) project.

The program generates public and private keypairs for [EOSIO](https://eos.io/)

Among the basic functionality the program can also search for keys containing specific words also know as _vanity keys_.

## Security notice

Keys are generated by `OpenSSL`'s `EC_KEY_generate_key` function. The program will
never expose your keys to anything but the computers memory and output of the
program. You are free to inspect the source code and compile yourself to verify.

However, use this at your own risk. we cannot guarantee that the keys are
cryptographically secure as this depends on OpenSSL's implementation (alto it is
widely used and should be safe)

Please read the `LICENSE.gui` file.
